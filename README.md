# Instagram Influencer Analysis Using SQL
## About the Project
This project analyzes an Instagram influencer’s account using SQL to uncover key insights on engagement trends, content performance, and audience growth. The dataset includes details on post types, impressions, reach, shares, and follower growth. By executing SQL queries, I extracted meaningful insights to optimize content strategies and improve social media engagement.

## Key Analyses & Insights
✔️ Identified 4 unique post types and their engagement metrics.
✔️ Found the highest & lowest recorded impressions for each post type.
✔️ Analyzed monthly profile visits & new followers to track account growth.
✔️ Calculated the percentage breakdown of total reach by post type.
✔️ Generated a report on unique post categories across months to analyze content variety.
✔️ Developed an SQL stored procedure to calculate total shares per post type per week.
